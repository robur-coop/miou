(** {1 The Unix layer of Miou.}

    This module offers a re-implementation of the I/O according to Miou's model.
    This module is essentially concerned with reading and writing
    [Unix.file_descr] from sockets, pipes, fifos, terminals (and
    pseudo-terminals) and probably devices. For all these types of [file_descr],
    reading/writing can block (waiting for bytes or waiting for the system's
    internal buffer to be free).

    This is not {i generally} the case for files and folders where
    [read]/[write] does not block. So, as far as files/folders are concerned,
    there is no point in using the suspend/resume mechanisms offered by Miou.
    These mechanisms (and the use of [Unix.select]) could actually degrade
    performance. It is therefore advisable to use the [Unix] module directly
    rather than [Miou_unix] for files/folders.

    It should be noted, however, that reading/writing files can take a long
    time. So, in a cooperative context (with [Miou.async]), it may be worthwhile
    to increase the availability of other tasks to run with [Miou.yield] - so
    associate a [Miou.yield] with these operations. However, in the case of
    parallelization ([Miou.call]), it is not necessary to cooperate with the
    other tasks as they run in parallel. In this sense, and depending on the
    design of your application, these operations should, or should not, be
    associated with a [Miou.yield].

    {2 How to spawn & handle processes with Miou_unix?}

    The [Miou_unix] module essentially only provides suspension points for
    reading and writing blocking {!type:file_descr} (such as sockets). But users
    would probably like another type of suspension: namely, suspension until a
    launched program (via [Unix.create_process]) has finished.

    The underlying mechanism provided by the system to signal the end of a
    program's execution is not related to {!type:file_descr} but to signals.
    Here is an example of how to launch and wait for the end of a program using
    signals and the {!module:Miou.Computation} module.

    {[
      let pid =
        Unix.create_process "sleep" [| "sleep"; "1" |] Unix.stdin Unix.stdout
          Unix.stderr
      in
      let c = Miou.Computation.create () in
      let handler _sigchld =
        match Unix.waitpid [ WNOHANG ] pid with
        | 0, _ -> ()
        | pid', status when pid' = pid ->
            ignore (Miou.sys_signal Sys.sigchld Sys.Signal_default);
            assert (Miou.Computation.try_return c status)
      in
      ignore (Miou.sys_signal Sys.sigchld (Sys.Signal_handle handler));
      match Miou.Computation.await_exn c with
      | Unix.WEXITED _ -> ()
      | Unix.WSIGNALED _ -> ()
      | Unix.WSTOPPED _ -> ()
    ]}

    Here are some explanations of the code above.
    + There is no reference to the [Miou_unix] module (although there are
      references to [Unix]). As we said, [Miou_unix] only manages
      {!type:file-descr}. In the code above, it is more about signal management.
    + First, a program is launched with [Unix.create_process] and a {i handler}
      is installed on the [SIGCHLD] signal. Please refer to the
      {!val:Miou.sys_signal} documentation.
    + This {i handler} then {i fills in} a {!type:Miou.Computation.t} value [c]
      which, at the same time, is suspended further on with
      {!val:Miou.Computation.await_exn}.

    The suspension performed by {!val:Miou.Computation.await_exn} can cooperate
    with the execution of other Miou tasks. In this way, the termination of the
    program is no longer blocking and you can, at the same time, execute tasks
    cooperatively and/or in parallel.

    The {i handler} function (which completes our {!type:Miou.Computation.t}) is
    {b always} executed by [dom0] (as specified in the {!val:Miou.sys_signal}
    documentation).

    Finally, it is entirely possible to extend this code in order to associate
    our {!type:Miou.Computation.t} with the PIDs of several launched programs
    (in a [Hashtbl], for example) in order to define a more generic {i handler}
    capable of unblocking several suspension points.

    {3 Why not integrate such a mechanism into [Miou_unix]?}

    This code currently has a global side effect: it installs a {i handler} to
    manage the [SIGCHLD] signal. [Miou] and [Miou_unix] are libraries that
    should only slightly modify the global state of your program.

    Therefore, it is your responsibility to install such a {i handler} in order
    to enforce the explicit nature of what your program does â€” and to prevent
    [Miou] and [Miou_unix] from doing things implicitly just because you want to
    depend on these libraries. *)
